# Untested STL files

If there are files here,
    they're an *untested* snapshot more recent than the last release.

The intent is to stage versions that may improve on the released version,
    but that I've not yet built.
Yet they should be safe for low cost local printing.

They'll likely be just the upper body and bottom plate, as the other parts
    are more fixed.
Use a suitable 3D slicer tool to create the mirrored left side versions.
