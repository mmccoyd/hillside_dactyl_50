# Blerb
A split choc keyboard
with a three-row contoured keywell
and a five-key double-arc thumb cluster
similar to the Dactyl Lightcycle.

The case design allows tight choc spacing, or a tad narrower.

Some key features are:

- Original Dactyl flat style thumb cluster, not gripping hand Manuform style.
- Focus on wireless, but with wired split support with a little case drilling.
- (Header for external switches (with a little case drilling))
- (Parametric design for tweaks within a modest range.)


# Blerb wrt others

A contoured keywell gives each finger its preferred height, like a choc Dactyl Lightcycle.
