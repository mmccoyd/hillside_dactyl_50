# Blurbs

## GitHub Blurb

A small Dactyl type choc-spaced keyboard (split contoured-keywell)
  with three main rows of six and a five-key double-arc thumb cluster.

## Rest of Readme

This is a Dactyl type case and bottom plate that go around the
  [Hillside MCU Breakout] guts
  and optional
  keywell [Amoeba Choc14]s.

Some key features are:

- Original Dactyl non-gripping motion thumb cluster.
- The case design allows choc 18 x 17 mm spacing, or a tad narrower.
- Focus on wireless, but with wired split support with a little case drilling.
- (Header for external switches (with a little case drilling))
- (Parametric design for tweaks within a modest range.)

## Blurb WRT other Hillsides

A contoured keywell gives each finger its preferred height
  for more comfort and easier chording.

## Name

Hillside Dactyl 50
