# STL files

The files here are for:

-   Left and right body parts - usually 3D printed in nylon or resin.
    -   Upper
    -   Bottom plate
    -   Keywell wiring aid
    -   Thumb wiring aid
-   Non-sided parts
    -   Magnetic tenting oval - likely laser cut from spring steel.
        A standard phone ring is an alternative.
        But it doesn't offer as much ease of tenting adjustment or angle.
    -   Display mount washer - likely laser cut from spring steel.
        There are other ways to secure the display, such as hot glue
        or very likely some normal washer.
        But the case is designed to use the laser cut tenting disk,
        so a laser cut washer is easy to source with that.
    -   Rear laptop hook - usually 3D printed
